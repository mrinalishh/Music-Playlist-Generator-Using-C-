# Music-Playlist-Generator-Using-C-
A console-based Playlist Generator developed in C that allows users to create and manage a music playlist. The application supports adding songs, removing songs, viewing the playlist, and shuffling tracks. This project was built to practice core C programming concepts such as file handling, structures, and basic data structures.
